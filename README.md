# Aider

Aider is an Android application which allows the Brands and Influencers to connect on the 
same platform, making the work of both these individuals easier. Having one platform means 
all they both have to do is register on the app and put in their details and thatâ€™s it! The app has 
two separate parts, one for the Influencer and one for the Brand with tabs catering to their 
own needs. They both can interact, apply to campaigns, make campaigns, connect through 
chat and find their social media platforms, all linked onto the same platform.

kindly open the master branch to view the project in full entirety :)
